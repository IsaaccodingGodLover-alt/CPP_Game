# CPP_Game **DECAPRITATED** CPP IS TOO MUCH OF A PAIN TO SET UP.
**This Is a C++ Game made for My End of Year Project**

I will be using this github repository as a save repo for my game [maybe I'll compile the code into WASM (Web Assembly) and run it in the browser. (Emscripten)]

I would love help, if you want to help email me at anonymous.schoolman@gmail.com
